# FAV

Script to handle my dir with the most favorite tracks.

# Introduction 
For many years I've been using Clementine as the main music player and I have a lot of favorite songs. And then, because of Clementine's 'Copy to device', I picked all of them out to a separate dir to sync it across devices by my own.
I also need to rename files and fix tags, but not in original collection. So, let's get started!
